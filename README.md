  ## Mark

Mark is a 60 years old man, who has been living in Alfred Cove, Western Australia with his wife for the last 30 years. He works part-time as a handyman. He has been an active member of South of the River Potters Club for 10 years. He has been recently elected as the president of the club. He is currently working on upgrading the club premises. He wants more people from the local community to join the club so that they can avail all the services offered by the club and this will also lead to empowering the club financially.

Mark's son gave him an idea of having a good website for the club which could be very beneficial for promoting the club to the next level. Mark gave the task of creating the website to Vipul and Jason who are the students at Coders Academy, Melbourne. Mark wants to have an admin functionality to the website so that he can perform certain tasks.
